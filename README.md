**Project Purpose:**  
This project aims to assist and figure about how to overcome the brain's non-stationary dynamics in some matter.
Our model purpose is to gain EEG data about when individual is thinking of moving his own left \ right arm.
It consists of a drone simulator developed with Unity that communicates through a socket connection with a Unicorn Black Suite BCI.
Network: socket with BCI, script named UdpConnection.

Data acquisition: we use python, https://github.com/bci4cpl/MI-Data.git .

**Current Prototype (Feb 17th):**  
We now hold a prototype version to begin data acquisition. 
This data will be used to train our Python models.
